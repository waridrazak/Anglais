What is up guys welcome back to my channel, my name is Warid and today i have a very interesting video for you guys today. Some of you may already watch my contents but for those of you who didn't know, i make videos of me playing video games and i also do live stream 
on twitch. People always ask me how much does my gaming computer cost and when i tell them the price they were shocked because it is way cheaper than they expected because my computer can run high-end games that require expensives hardwares. Well the reason for the price
is i build my gaming computer myself! It's 2025 guys stop being lazy and save your money by building the pc yourselves. So in today's video I'm going to teach you guys how to build a gaming computer so that you can play the games that you have been wanting to. Let's talk 
about the basic internal components that you must have. First of all the central processing unit which mainly known as CPU. It  is the primary component of a computer that performs most of the processing inside. It's often referred to as the "brain" of the computer because 
it carries out instructions from programs by performing basic arithmetic, logic, control, and input/output operations.
